    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken salad is a light and flavorful dish made by combining cooked, shredded or chopped chicken with various fresh ingredients like lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions. The chicken can be grilled, boiled, or roasted, and is often mixed with a dressing such as mayonnaise, yogurt, or a vinaigrette to add creaminess and flavor.</p>
    <p>This salad is versatile and can include extras like boiled eggs, avocado, cheese, or nuts for added texture and nutrition. Itâ€™s commonly served chilled, making it a refreshing option for lunch or dinner, and can be eaten on its own, in a sandwich, or wrapped in a tortilla for a quick and healthy meal.</p>
