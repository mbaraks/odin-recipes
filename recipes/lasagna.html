    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that's both comforting and easy to make, especially when simplified for a quick meal. This easy version layers cooked lasagna noodles with a rich meat sauce made from ground beef, tomato sauce, garlic, and Italian herbs. A creamy mixture of ricotta cheese, egg, and Parmesan adds richness, while shredded mozzarella gives it that irresistible gooey topping. The layers are repeated until the dish is full, then it's baked until bubbly and golden on top.</p>
    <p>This recipe is perfect for beginners or busy cooks because it doesn't require complicated steps or hard-to-find ingredients. You can use store-bought sauce to save time, and pre-shredded cheese works just as well. After about 45 minutes in the oven, the result is a hearty, satisfying meal that tastes like it took hours to prepare. Serve it with a side of garlic bread or a fresh salad for a complete and delicious dinner.</p>
