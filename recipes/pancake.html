    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Banana pancakes are a sweet and simple breakfast dish made by mixing ripe mashed bananas into a basic pancake batter. The bananas add natural sweetness, moisture, and a soft texture to the pancakes, making them a healthy and tasty twist on the classic recipe. They are often cooked on a lightly greased skillet until golden brown on both sides.</p>
    <p>These pancakes can be enjoyed plain or topped with extras like honey, syrup, fresh fruits, or nuts. They're popular for being quick to prepare and a great way to use overripe bananas. Banana pancakes are also a common choice for those looking for a wholesome, filling, and flavorful morning meal.</p>
